# Problem Description

This is the same problem described by [this reference blog](http://www.wildml.com/2015/09/implementing-a-neural-network-from-scratch/).

**Objective**: train a Machine Learning **classifier** that predicts the correct class (male (1) or female (0)) given the x- and y- coordinates.

# Training Data

The same as in the reference and can be generated by the [dataGen.py](dataset/dataGen.py) script.

# Neural Network

* Input=(x,y) 2D coordinates of points
* Output=(probability of male, probability of female) vector of probabilities whose sum is 1. It can also be described by a single integer as the index of the higher probability (0 for male as for the first index, 1 for female as for the second index)
  * (1,0) => 0 => male
  * (0,1) => 1 => female
